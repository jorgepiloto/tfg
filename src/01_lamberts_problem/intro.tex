\chapter{Review of Lambert's problem}

In this chapter, the problem statement, geometry, solutions and singularities
are revisited. The analysis presented here is strongly influenced by
\cite{escobal1970}, \cite{el1968} and \cite{battin1999} works. All scenarios,
including multiple revolutions and degenerate ones are considered. Before
reading next sections it is recommended to read APPENDIX XX for a quick review
of orbital mechanics and to get familiar with the notation presented to be used.
