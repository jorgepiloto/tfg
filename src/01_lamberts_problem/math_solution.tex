\section{Geometry and nature of the solutions}

It is possible to expose the nature of all the possible solutions for a generic
set of $\vec{r_{1}}$, $\vec{r_{2}}$, and $\Delta t$ without carrying out any
deep mathematical analysis.

Let us consider for a moment that the value of $a$ is known. This quickly
enables us to classify the type or orbit: elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic one.
Each one of these conic curves holds a relation about the distance between any
