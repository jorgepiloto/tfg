\section{Classification}

With such amount of algorithms, a classification is required to better organize
their approach when finding the solution to the problem and also for depicting
inheritances among them.

\subsection{Universal formulation based}
\subsection{Semi-major axis based}
\subsection{Eccentricity based}
\subsection{Orbit parameter based}
\subsection{Kustaanheimo-Stiefel based}
