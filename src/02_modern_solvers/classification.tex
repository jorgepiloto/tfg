\section{Classification and inheritance diagram}

The amount of devised solutions along Lambert's problem timeline is massive.
However, after spotting some common points between different solvers, it is
possible to classify them according to the free-parameter employed, the
numerical method used, the initial guess procedure or the velocity vectors
construction. Among these four, the classification based on the free-parameter
is the most interesting one, as there is a fixed number of these variables which
can be used to address the iteration problem.

In addition to the classification presented in the following lines, an
inheritance diagram has been produced so reader can have a better understanding
about the relations between the different published solvers over time.

Although some solvers may appear in the inheritance diagram, they have not been
included in the performance comparison because the ones which inherit from them
have been proof to be efficient than the original ones.

\subsection{Eccentricity based}
\subsection{Orbit parameter based}
\subsection{Kustaanheimo-Stiefel based}
