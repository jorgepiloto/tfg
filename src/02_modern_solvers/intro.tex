\chapter{Modern Lambert's problem solvers}

This chapter is devoted to the study of modern Lambert's problem solvers and it
is the core of this work. By introducing their origin and proposing a
classification for them, the reader is expected to acquire a deep-knowledge in
the state-of-the-art of the available solutions to the BVP problem.
