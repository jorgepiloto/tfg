\section{Comparative table of elements}

After introducing all solvers in a more detailed way, it is convenient to
collect all the information an present it to reader in a more compact way. This
is the goal of table \ref{table:elements} provided at the end of this section, in which the different
elements and steps used by each solver have been collected.

Although the free-parameters are various, it is possible to see some common
elements between the selected modern solvers. For example, those ones using a
numerical method make use of high order one to ensure quick convergence or a
bounded one, so the solution is always achieved. Not only that, for the velocity
vectors construction, the preferred approach seems to be through the usage of
$f$ and $g$ functions. Regarding the initial guess, rational formulae is the
most popular among the solvers presented in this work. Other initial guess
procedures like linear or bi-linear can also be found.
