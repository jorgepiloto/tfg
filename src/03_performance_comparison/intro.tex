\chapter{Performance comparison}

The main goal of this chapter is to present the different algorithms selected
for the performance comparison together with the tools developed and the
analysis itself. At first, each algorithm is presented with its
fundamental equations, inheritance and improvements over other solvers
when available. Figures showing the non-dimensional time of flight curves as
function of the free-parameter are provided too so reader can have a better
understanding on the relation between the two magnitudes.
