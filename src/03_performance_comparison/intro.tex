\chapter{Performance comparison}

The main goal of this chapter is to present the different algorithms selected
for the performance comparison together with the tools developed and the
analysis itself. At first, each algorithm is presented with its
fundamental equations, inheritance and improvements over other solvers
when available. Figures showing the non-dimensional time of flight curves as
function of the free-parameter are provided too so reader can have a better
understanding on the relation between the two magnitudes.

Previous studies made by \cite{klumpp1999}, \cite{torre2015} and in
\cite{martinez2021} were used as the main source of information for this section
and their analysis improved. 

All algorithms have been implemented under the Python programming language and a
library named \citetitle{lamberthub_v01}\footnote{The software can be accessed
in
\href{https://github.com/jorgepiloto/lamberthub}{https://github.com/jorgepiloto/lamberthub}.}
created under a public license, so any author can access it. This software
package ships with all the necessary tools to evaluate the performance of a
solver too and it has been heavily tested again literature cases not only for
the direct transfer problem but also for the multiple revolutions one.
