\chapter{Introduction to selected solvers}
\label{performance_chapter}

The selected solver are presented in a detailed way in this chapter. The
fundamental equations relating the non-dimensional time of flight with the
free-parameter are provided for each one together. By plotting those for various
transfer angles, it is possible to build the so-called \textit{time of flight
curves} also included for each solver. Finally, a resume table at the end of the
chapter collects the main elements used by every of the selected solvers so the
comparison among them is easier for the reader.
