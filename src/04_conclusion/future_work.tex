\section{Future work}

The results presented in this work might be enhanced and expanded in a future by
considering the addition of more Lambert's problem solvers and metrics. These
would allow to carry out more complex performance analysis. Some ideas are
listed down:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Error color palette.} Define a set of colors associated to
		particular errors such us exceeding maximum number of iterations
		or wrong algorithm input.  Those would allow to properly
		identify which problem was found in the black regions of the
		non-dimensional time versus the transfer angle contour plots.

	\item \textbf{Multi-revolution analysis.} Expand the analysis to the
		multi-revolution scenario, as this work only considered the
		direct-arc transfer problem.

	\item \textbf{Implement more solvers.} Implement more Lambert's problem
		solvers under the same library and programming language so the
		performance comparison is fair.  The \citetitle{lamberthub_v01}
		provides all the required tools for carrying out this task.

	\item \textbf{Memory usage analysis.} A comparison using the metric of
		memory usage might be also interesting to establish the minimum
		requirements for a CPU to make use a solver.

	\item \textbf{Parallelization analysis.} This analysis would be devoted
		to the investigation of how suitable is for a solver to be
		implemented using high performance computing techniques based on
		GPU parallelization.
\end{itemize}
