\chapter{Results}

This chapter is devoted to the presentation of the performance results. Three
different metrics were developed to measure the performance of a solver: the
number of iterations, the total time per iteration and the total computation
time. Contour plots evaluating each of the previous metrics are provided
relating values of the non-dimensional transfer angle with the non-dimensional
time of flight. A comparison table is provided at the end of the chapter as a
resume.
