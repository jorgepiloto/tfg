\chapter*{Abstract}

This work presents a deep performance comparison from both the analytical and
computational point of view of a variety of modern Lambert's problem solvers.
The analyzed solvers are \cite{gauss1809}, \cite{battin1984},
\cite{gooding1990}, \cite{avanzini2008}, \cite{arora2013}, \cite{vallado2013}
and \cite{izzo2015}.

A quick review on the problem's timeline, geometry, possible solutions and
singularities are presented at first. This is followed by an explanation on the
different elements required by any solver together with a proposed way on how to
classify these algorithms.

Each selected solver is analyzed considering the free-parameter employed, the
initial guess procedure, the numerical root solver and the way velocity vectors
are constructed. Figures for the time of flight as function of the independent
variable are provided.

The performance comparison is carried out for all possible combinations of the
transfer angle and non-dimensional time considering the total number of
iterations, the time per iteration and the total computation time. The results
are provided in the form of contour plots. A resume table with a conclusion on
the obtained results is included too.

Finally, some ideas about how the performance comparison could be extended and
enhanced are included in the last chapter.
